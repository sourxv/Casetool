Q)Write a program to calculate the percentage of a given student in the CBSE board exam. 
His marks from 5 subjects must be taken as input from the keyboard. (Marks are out of 100)

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Pactice {
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//max is used so that number of input for user is restricted to 100
		 int max = 100;
		 // we took 5 variables as 5 so we can take 5 inputs 
		 int sub1,sub2,sub3,sub4,sub5,total,per;
		 
		 Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		 
		 //inputs from user
		 System.out.println("enter marks of english");
		 sub1 = input.nextInt();
		 
		 System.out.println("enter marks of Maths");
		 sub2 = input.nextInt();
		 
		 System.out.println("enter marks of marathi");
		 sub3 = input.nextInt();
		 
		 System.out.println("enter marks of hindi");
		 sub4 = input.nextInt();
		 
		 System.out.println("enter marks of Science");
		 sub5 = input.nextInt();
		 
		 //total marks add from userInput
		 total = sub1 + sub2 + sub3 + sub4 + sub5;
		 System.out.println("total marks are " + total);
		 
		 //percentage of total marks (formula Used)
		 per = total*100/500;
		 System.out.println("percentage of student is " + per);
